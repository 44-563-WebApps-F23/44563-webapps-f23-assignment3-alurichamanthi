     beauty and vibrant culture. The rolling Ozark Mountains, scenic rivers, and lush forests provide
     endless opportunities for outdoor adventures like hiking, canoeing, and camping. What I love most

Here are three activities you can enjoy in **Missouri**, listed in order of my preference:

1. **Hiking in the Ozarks**: Exploring the picturesque trails of the Ozark Mountains is my top choice. The rugged terrain, stunning vistas, and serene atmosphere make it a hiker's paradise.
