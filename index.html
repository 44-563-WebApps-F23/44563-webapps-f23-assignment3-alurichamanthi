    <title>My Favorite Vacation Spot</title>
</head>


<blockquote>
  <p>My favorite vacation spot is <strong>Missouri</strong> . This central U.S. state offers a unique blend of natural
     beauty and vibrant culture. The rolling Ozark Mountains, scenic rivers, and lush forests provide
     endless opportunities for outdoor adventures like hiking, canoeing, and camping. What I love most 
     about <strong>Missouri</strong> is its warm and friendly people, who make you feel right at home. 
     The rich history, delicious barbecue, and charming small towns make it a perfect getaway.</p>
